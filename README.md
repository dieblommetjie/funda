# funda
Students frequently require funding for their tertiary studies, but they must submit countless individual applications that are frequently limited to large corporations.

A system was designed and developed that holds the data of students requiring funding. Individuals or businesses are able to browse and sponsor/fund these students. 
This eliminated the endless application process and opened up the process to individuals or smaller companies to fund students as well... all in one place!

- Implemented a desktop application that created a bridge between students and funders
- Applied CRUD principles as well as UX/UI best practices within the agile team environment
- Created using primarily C# .Net and SQL

#TODO
